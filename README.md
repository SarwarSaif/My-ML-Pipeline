# My-ML-Pipeline
This Repo will consists of a simple End-to-End modern pipeline

## To-Do:
1. **Deploy Machine Learning Models with Django**
2. Create a Dashboard with Plotly [https://plotly.com/dash/](https://plotly.com/dash/)
3. Dockerize the whole model 
4. From Build to Dockerize use Jenkins to fetch

## PC Setup

| git flow | 0.4.1 |
| python | 3.8 | 
| Django | 2.2.4 | 

### Clone Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/SarwarSaif/My-ML-Pipeline.git
```

### Create a Virtual Env under the Project Folder
```
cd projectfolder # go to project folder
python3 -m venv ./venv
```

## This ML System Strength
- can handle many API endpoints,
- each API endpoint can have several ML algorithms with different versions,
- ML code and artifacts (files with ML parameters) are stored in the code repository (git),
- supports fast deployments and continuous integration (tests for both: server and ML code),
- supports monitoring and algorithm diagnostic (support A/B tests),
- is scalable (deployed with containers),
has a user interface.
